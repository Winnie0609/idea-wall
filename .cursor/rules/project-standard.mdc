## Code Patterns & Standards

### Component Patterns

- Prefer server components by default, use `"use client"` directive only when necessary (interactivity, hooks, browser APIs)
- Follow Next.js App Router patterns and conventions
- Use TypeScript strict mode for all files
- Export named functions for components when possible
- Use pnpm for all package management

### Styling

- Use `cn()` utility for conditional classes: `import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"`
- Follow Tailwind CSS best practices
- Use shadcn/ui components as base components

### Code Quality

- All code comments must be in English
- Do not use emojis in code
- Write clean, maintainable, and self-documenting code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Follow consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components/types)

### Type Safety

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Define proper types and interfaces
- Use Zod for runtime validation
- Avoid `any` type unless absolutely necessary

### State Management

- Use TanStack Query for server state management
- Leverage React Query's caching and invalidation strategies
- Use React hooks for local component state

### Database & Backend

- Use Supabase for database operations and authentication
- Follow Supabase best practices for queries and real-time subscriptions
- Implement proper error handling for database operations

## File Organization

- Follow Next.js App Router file structure
- Co-locate related files (components, hooks, utilities)
- Use barrel exports (`index.ts`) where appropriate
- Keep components small and focused
